A project made by a **beginner/intermediate** in programming with the total intention of learning Python technology:

## A little about the repository

Here is a repository in which I will be posting my personal projects and also college projects,
with the intention of evolving more and more in this vast language that is Python.

I will be leaving comments on some of these projects so that those who are interested can understand what is happening in the project and in the code.
